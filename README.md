# Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Multi-Mode-Security-Tool-v0.0.5
Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Multi-Mode-Security-Tool-v0.0.5 is a next-generation cybersecurity framework designed to empower analysts, ethical hackers, and security engineers with a powerful, flexible, and modern multi-mode interface. Built for both offensive security testing and defensive threat analysis, the tool seamlessly integrates network penetration-testing capabilities with an advanced social-engineering operations module, making it a complete cyber-assessment and cyber-drill platform.

The tool operates in two modes: a clean, menu-driven graphical interface for easy navigation, and a fast, command-line mode for expert operators who prefer hands-on control. 
This dual-mode architecture offers unmatched convenience and speed, enabling users to move between automated scanning and manual exploitation effortlessly.

Its network security engine includes intelligent port scanning, vulnerability detection, service enumeration, network mapping, packet analysis, and exploit execution. 
Meanwhile, the social-engineering suite supports phishing simulations, credential-harvesting workflows, payload delivery tools, spoofing utilities, and human-factor testing modules—allowing organizations to evaluate the weakest link: human behavior.

Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Multi-Mode-Security-Tool-v0.0.5 is built with a modern cyber-engineering approach, ensuring efficiency, modularity, high performance, and security. 
Whether for red-team exercises, cyber-training, ethical hacking, or research, this tool provides a complete environment for understanding, testing, and strengthening digital defenses in real-world scenarios.
